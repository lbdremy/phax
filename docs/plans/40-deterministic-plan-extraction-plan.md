## Context

Today `phax extract-plan` always routes `plan.md` through an LLM
(`extractPlanLlm` in `src/app/extractPlan.ts`) to produce an `ExtractedPhaxPlan`,
which `finalizeExtractedPlan` (`src/domain/plan/finalize.ts`) then post-processes
deterministically (titles, anchors, slug, branch, warnings).

Every field the LLM is asked to emit maps to an unambiguous markdown marker that
the `phax-planning` skill already mandates (`## phase-NN — … {#anchor}`,
`**Recommended model:** …`, `### Planned files to create`, `### Commit subject`,
`## Required commands`, …). The LLM is doing purely mechanical structural
extraction — work a deterministic markdown parser does faster, for free, and
reproducibly.

This plan adds a pure deterministic extractor built on an **mdast** syntax tree
(`mdast-util-from-markdown`) chosen for robustness over hand-rolled regex, wires
it as the first attempt in `loadOrExtractPlan`, and keeps the LLM as the
fallback for non-conforming or drifted plans (the LLM tolerates formatting
slop that a strict parser rejects). The deterministic extractor produces the
**same** `ExtractedPhaxPlan` shape and is validated through the **same**
`ExtractedPhaxPlanSchema`, so the entire downstream path (finalize, cache,
schema trip-wire) is unchanged. A parser bug therefore cannot inject malformed
data — the strict decode rejects it and the run falls back to the LLM.

The existing `examples/hello-world/plan.md` predates the current skill format
(no `## Required commands`, no planned-file sections, backtick-wrapped commit
subjects) and must be updated to the canonical, deterministically-parseable
form.

Key mdast facts the extractor relies on:

- `fromMarkdown(text)` returns a `root` node with `children`; block nodes carry
  `position.{start,end}.offset` into the source string.
- A phase heading parses as `{ type: 'heading', depth: 2, children: [...] }`;
  the `{#anchor}` is literal text inside the heading (CommonMark has no anchor
  syntax), so it appears in the heading's flattened text.
- `**Recommended model:** X` and `**Recommended effort:** Y` sit in **one**
  paragraph (soft line break, no blank line between), so flattening with
  `mdast-util-to-string` would concatenate the two values; read such fields by
  slicing the paragraph's source via `position` offsets and applying a line
  regex instead.
- A backtick-wrapped commit subject parses as an `inlineCode` node — read
  `.value` (or strip surrounding backticks) so the subject is stored unwrapped.

## Required commands

- pnpm add

The mdast dependencies are installed with `pnpm add` (`pnpm add
mdast-util-from-markdown mdast-util-to-string` and `pnpm add -D @types/mdast`).
`pnpm add` is **not** covered by the existing narrow `pnpm gen:usage-spec` /
`pnpm docs:cli` allowances — those are exact-command grants, not a broad `pnpm`
allowance — so it must be granted explicitly (see below). The parser introduces
no new *runtime* command the agent must invoke.

## Required PHAX security configuration changes

This plan requires the following command to be added to `security.agentCommands`
in `phax.json` before running:

- `pnpm add`

Without it the preflight check fails before any agent spawns. (On the first run
of this plan this grant was missing, so the agent could not install the mdast
dependencies and silently fell back to a hand-rolled tokenizer — a deviation
that also introduced a commit-body parsing bug. The grant is now present in this
repo's `phax.json`.)

## Dependencies

Phase-03 edits `.claude/skills/phax-planning/SKILL.md`, which is a **Claude-Code
protected path**: under the secure `acceptEdits` permission mode the headless
agent cannot write there, which is why the SKILL.md edit was skipped on the
first run. Before re-running this plan, either:

- land the protected-path approval-hook feature (see
  `docs/plans/41-claude-protected-path-approval-hook-plan.md`) and add
  `.claude/skills/` to `security.filesystem.allowWriteProtected` in `phax.json`,
  so the agent is granted scoped permission to edit the planned `.claude/**`
  file; or
- apply the phase-03 SKILL.md edit manually as a follow-up.

The non-protected `.agents/skills/phax-planning/SKILL.md` mirror can be edited by
the agent without the hook.

## phase-01 — mdast-based deterministic extractor {#phase-01-deterministic-extractor}

**Recommended model:** claude-opus-4-8
**Recommended effort:** medium

Add a pure domain function `extractPlanDeterministic(planMd)` that parses a
conforming `plan.md` into a validated `ExtractedPhaxPlan` using an mdast tree,
returning `Either<PlanValidationError, ExtractedPhaxPlan>`. This is the core of
the feature; no app wiring yet.

### Detailed instructions

- Add dependencies with `pnpm add mdast-util-from-markdown mdast-util-to-string`
  and `pnpm add -D @types/mdast`. These are pure (no I/O), so importing them in
  `src/domain/` is allowed by the architecture audit; do not add them to
  `knip.json` `ignoreDependencies` (they are used in this phase).
- Create `src/domain/plan/parsePlanMarkdown.ts` exporting
  `extractPlanDeterministic(planMd: string): Either.Either<ExtractedPhaxPlan, PlanValidationError>`.
- Parse once with `fromMarkdown(planMd)`. Walk `root.children` linearly:
  - **Run title**: the first `depth: 1` heading's flattened text
    (`mdast-util-to-string`). Use it for both `run.title` and `run.shortName`
    (finalize slugifies `shortName`, falling back to `slugify(title)`), matching
    today's LLM behavior. Fail with a precise `PlanValidationError` if absent.
  - **Required commands**: the `depth: 2` heading whose text is exactly
    `Required commands`, then the following `list` node's item texts. A single
    `- (none)` item (case-insensitive, parens optional) means `[]`. The section
    must appear before the first phase heading.
  - **Phase blocks**: each `depth: 2` heading whose flattened text matches
    `/^phase-\d{2}\b/`. Collect every node after it up to (not including) the
    next `depth: 2` heading as that phase's block.
- For each phase block, extract the `ExtractedPhaseSchema` fields:
  - `id`: from the heading via `/^(phase-\d{2})\b/` (lowercased).
  - `planMarkdownAnchor`: the `{#…}` content from the heading, stored **with a
    leading `#` and without braces** — e.g. `{#phase-01-greet-function}` →
    `"#phase-01-greet-function"`. This must match the format the existing
    tests assert (see `tests/unit/extractPlanFinalize.test.ts`,
    `tests/unit/extractPlan.test.ts`, where anchors are `"#phase-01-alpha"`
    etc.). Fail if the heading has no anchor.
  - `model` / `effort`: locate the paragraph in the block containing
    `Recommended model:`; slice its source with
    `planMd.slice(p.position.start.offset, p.position.end.offset)` and apply
    `/Recommended model:\s*\**\s*(\S+)/` and
    `/Recommended effort:\s*\**\s*(\S+)/`. Do **not** flatten the paragraph with
    `mdast-util-to-string` (it would join the two values). `effort` must decode
    against the `EffortSchema` literals; fail otherwise.
  - `plannedFilesToCreate` / `plannedFilesToEdit` / `optionalFilesToEdit`: the
    `list` following the `depth: 3` heading whose text is exactly
    `Planned files to create` / `Planned files to edit` /
    `Optional files that may be edited`. Map each list item to its trimmed text;
    a single `- (none)` item means `[]`. All three sections are required.
  - `commit.subject`: the first paragraph after the `depth: 3` `Commit subject`
    heading, flattened and stripped of a surrounding `inlineCode`/backtick wrap,
    as a single non-empty line.
  - `commit.body`: the block(s) after the `depth: 3` `Commit body` heading up to
    the next heading; preserve the source via `position` offsets, trimmed, as a
    non-empty string.
- Assemble `{ version: 1, run, phases }` and **decode it through
  `ExtractedPhaxPlanSchema`** (the existing strict decoder with
  `onExcessProperty: "error"`). Return `Either.right` on success;
  `Either.left(new PlanValidationError({ message }))` on any failure. Every
  failure message must name the phase id and the missing/ambiguous field so the
  fallback in phase-02 can log a useful reason.
- Keep the function pure: no `FileSystem`, no `Backend`, no I/O. The caller
  supplies `planMd` text.

### Planned files to create

- `src/domain/plan/parsePlanMarkdown.ts`
- `tests/unit/parsePlanMarkdown.test.ts`

### Planned files to edit

- `package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### Optional files that may be edited

- `knip.json`

### Boundary contracts

Producer: `src/domain/plan/parsePlanMarkdown.ts` provides
`extractPlanDeterministic(planMd) → Either<ExtractedPhaxPlan, PlanValidationError>`.
Consumer (phase-02): `src/app/loadOrExtractPlan.ts`. The stable contract is the
return type — the `Right` value is byte-for-byte what the LLM path + the strict
schema would yield, so the existing `finalizeExtractedPlan` consumes it
unchanged.

### Test strategy

Domain logic → unit tests, written before implementation. Cover:

- A conforming multi-phase plan → exact expected `ExtractedPhaxPlan` (assert the
  whole object, including `#`-prefixed anchors and `requiredCommands`).
- `- (none)` handling for required-commands and all three planned-file lists.
- Backtick-wrapped commit subject is stored unwrapped.
- Em-dash, en-dash, and hyphen heading separators all parse.
- Missing model line, missing anchor, missing a planned-file section, and an
  invalid `effort` each return `Either.left` with a phase/field-specific message.

### Implementation order

Schema/decoder reuse first (import `ExtractedPhaxPlanSchema`), then the mdast
walk, then field extractors, then the strict decode at the boundary.

### Excluded scope

- Any change to `loadOrExtractPlan` / app wiring (phase-02).
- Updating the example plan or skill docs (phase-03).

### Verification

- The project's configured `full` gate profile in `phax.json`.

### Expected handoff content

- The exact export signature of `extractPlanDeterministic` and its module path.
- The decided `planMarkdownAnchor` output format (`#phase-NN-slug`) and a note
  that it matches the existing finalize/extract tests.
- The shape of `PlanValidationError` messages (which fields are named) so
  phase-02 can surface them as fallback warnings.
- Any deviation from the planned file lists, with the reason.

### Commit subject

feat(plan): add mdast-based deterministic plan extractor

### Commit body

Add extractPlanDeterministic in src/domain/plan, a pure function that parses a
conforming plan.md into a validated ExtractedPhaxPlan via an mdast syntax tree
and returns Either<ExtractedPhaxPlan, PlanValidationError>. Output is decoded
through the existing strict ExtractedPhaxPlanSchema so it is identical to the
LLM path. Adds mdast-util-from-markdown, mdast-util-to-string, and @types/mdast.
Covered by unit tests for conforming plans, (none) lists, dash variants, and the
failure paths that trigger the fallback.

## phase-02 — Deterministic-first wiring with LLM fallback {#phase-02-fallback-wiring}

**Recommended model:** claude-sonnet-4-6
**Recommended effort:** medium

Make `loadOrExtractPlan` attempt the deterministic extractor first and only
invoke the LLM (and the cache) when the deterministic parse fails, surfacing the
fallback reason as a warning.

### Detailed instructions

- Edit `src/app/loadOrExtractPlan.ts`: after reading `planMd` and before the
  cache lookup, call `extractPlanDeterministic(planMd)`.
  - On `Either.right(extracted)`: run `finalizeExtractedPlan(extracted, planMd)`
    and return its result with `fromCache: false`. Do **not** read or write the
    cache on this path (the parse is instant and content-deterministic).
  - On `Either.left(parseError)`: fall through to the existing cache → LLM →
    cache-write → finalize path unchanged, but append a warning of the form
    `Deterministic extraction failed (<parseError.message>); fell back to LLM.`
    to the returned `warnings` so the user sees why the LLM ran.
- Respect existing flags: `--refresh` still bypasses the cache on the LLM path;
  `--no-extract` must still fail on a cache miss **after** a deterministic
  failure (i.e. deterministic success satisfies `--no-extract`; deterministic
  failure with no cache and `--no-extract` keeps today's error).
- Do not change `LoadOrExtractResult`'s shape beyond what already exists; reuse
  `warnings` to carry the fallback note. Keep `extractPlanCore` /
  `extractPlan` behavior intact (they call `loadOrExtractPlan`).

### Planned files to create

- `tests/unit/loadOrExtractPlan.test.ts`

### Planned files to edit

- `src/app/loadOrExtractPlan.ts`

### Optional files that may be edited

- `src/app/extractPlan.ts`

### Boundary contracts

Consumer: `src/app/loadOrExtractPlan.ts` needs
`extractPlanDeterministic(planMd) → Either<ExtractedPhaxPlan, PlanValidationError>`
from phase-01. Producer/consumer split with the `Backend` port is unchanged —
the LLM path still goes through `extractPlanLlm`; this phase only gates whether
that path runs.

### Test strategy

Application command with fake ports → unit/integration tests, written before
implementation, using a fake `Backend` that records `complete` calls:

- Conforming plan → `backend.complete` is **not** called; returned plan matches
  the deterministic extraction; `fromCache` is `false`.
- Non-conforming plan → `backend.complete` is called exactly once; the result
  carries the `fell back to LLM` warning.
- `--no-extract` with a conforming plan succeeds without the backend; with a
  non-conforming plan and no cache it fails as today.

### Implementation order

Wire the deterministic attempt at the top of `loadOrExtractPlan`, then the
fallback warning threading, then confirm flag interactions.

### Excluded scope

- The parser itself (phase-01).
- Example/skill documentation (phase-03).

### Verification

- The project's configured `full` gate profile in `phax.json`.

### Expected handoff content

- Confirmation that conforming plans no longer call the backend, and the exact
  warning string used on fallback.
- How `--refresh` and `--no-extract` interact with the deterministic path.
- Any deviation from the planned file lists, with the reason.

### Commit subject

feat(app): try deterministic plan extraction before the LLM

### Commit body

Wire extractPlanDeterministic into loadOrExtractPlan as the first attempt: a
conforming plan.md is parsed without any LLM call or cache access, and only a
deterministic parse failure falls through to the existing cache/LLM path, with
the failure reason surfaced as a warning. Covered by unit tests asserting the
backend is not invoked for conforming plans and is invoked once on fallback.

## phase-03 — Canonicalize the example plan and document the parser {#phase-03-example-and-docs}

**Recommended model:** claude-sonnet-4-6
**Recommended effort:** low

Update `examples/hello-world/plan.md` to the canonical, deterministically-parseable
format, document the deterministic-first/LLM-fallback behavior in the
`phax-planning` skill, and lock the example with a regression test asserting it
parses without the LLM.

### Detailed instructions

- Rewrite `examples/hello-world/plan.md` to conform exactly to the current
  skill format: add a top-level `## Required commands` section (`- (none)`), add
  `### Planned files to create`, `### Planned files to edit`, and
  `### Optional files that may be edited` to every phase, and write commit
  subjects as plain (unwrapped) conventional-commit lines. Keep the three-phase
  greet/test/document story.
- Edit the `phax-planning` skill (both mirrors —
  `.agents/skills/phax-planning/SKILL.md` and
  `.claude/skills/phax-planning/SKILL.md`): in "What phax expects", state that
  `phax extract-plan` first parses a conforming `plan.md` deterministically via
  an mdast tree and only falls back to the LLM when the deterministic parse
  fails; document that `run.title` is the first `# ` H1 heading and
  `run.shortName` is slugified from it; note that conforming exactly to the
  format keeps extraction LLM-free, reproducible, and offline.
  - `.claude/skills/...` is a protected path (see **Dependencies** above): only
    edit it if the approval-hook feature is active and `phax.json` grants
    `.claude/skills/`. Otherwise edit `.agents/skills/...` only and record the
    `.claude` mirror as a manual follow-up in the handoff.
- Add `tests/unit/examplePlanDeterministic.test.ts`: read
  `examples/hello-world/plan.md` from disk and assert
  `extractPlanDeterministic` returns `Either.right` with the expected phase ids,
  anchors, and `requiredCommands` — a regression guard that the shipped example
  stays on the deterministic path.

### Planned files to create

- `tests/unit/examplePlanDeterministic.test.ts`

### Planned files to edit

- `examples/hello-world/plan.md`
- `.agents/skills/phax-planning/SKILL.md`

### Optional files that may be edited

- `.claude/skills/phax-planning/SKILL.md`

### Boundary contracts

Omit — this phase crosses no architectural boundary.

### Test strategy

The example is a fixture for a unit test that exercises the phase-01 domain
function end-to-end on the real shipped file. Written alongside the example
rewrite so the test and the canonical format land together.

### Implementation order

Rewrite the example first, then the regression test against it, then the skill
documentation.

### Excluded scope

- Any change to the parser or the wiring (phase-01, phase-02).
- The e2e fixture `tests/e2e/fixtures/minimal-repo/plan.md` (out of scope; it
  has its own lifecycle).

### Verification

- The project's configured `full` gate profile in `phax.json`.

### Expected handoff content

- Confirmation that the shipped example parses deterministically (test green).
- The exact skill wording added about deterministic-first extraction and the
  `run.title`/`shortName` convention.
- Any deviation from the planned file lists, with the reason.

### Commit subject

docs(plan): canonicalize hello-world example and document deterministic extraction

### Commit body

Update examples/hello-world/plan.md to the current skill format (required
commands, planned-file sections, unwrapped commit subjects) so it parses on the
deterministic path, document the deterministic-first/LLM-fallback behavior and
the run.title/shortName convention in the phax-planning skill, and add a unit
test that reads the shipped example and asserts it extracts without the LLM.
